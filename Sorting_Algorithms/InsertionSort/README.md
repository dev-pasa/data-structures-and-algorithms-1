# Insertion Sort

## Explanation 
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array of integers element by element, moving from left to right and is efficient on lists
that contain ~less than 50 elements. 

## Big O
Time Complexity: Worst case is O(n^2)
Spac Complexity: O(1), sorts "in place" and is stable
