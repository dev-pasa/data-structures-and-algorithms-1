# Quicksort

## Explanation 
Quick sort partitions an array and recursively moves all elements smaller than the pivot point to the left subarray and all elements larger than the pivot point
to the righ subarray until the initial array is sorted.

## Big O
Time Complexity: Worst case is O(n^2), Average case is O(nlogn)
Space Complexity: O(h) (height of the stack)
