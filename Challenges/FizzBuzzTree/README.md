# FizzBuzz Tree

## Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.
C# directions: Instead of changing the values of the nodes, output to the console the new values respectively.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Time Complexity = O(n): Must traverse the whole tree
* Space Compexity = O(h): Where h is the height of the tree
