# Repeated word

## Challenge
Given a lengthy string as input, return the first repeated word.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Time Complexity = O(n): Where n is the number of separate tokens (i.e., mostly words) in the input string
* Space Complexity = O(n): We use an additional array and HashTable of size n
