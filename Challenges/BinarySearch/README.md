# Binary Search

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearhc() which takes in a sorted array and the target value to find.
The function should return the index of the target value in the array if the target value is found. 
Otherwise, the function should return -1;

## Approach & Efficiency
* Time Complexity = O(logn): The total search space halves each iteration.
* Space Compexity = O(1): No significant space is used
